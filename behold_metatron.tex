% { \begin{quotation} Brooklyn Sol Yurick \& Anticipation of the Night A fire sale at Bear Stearns. Markets in turmoil. Sub-prime disasters. IRAs and TDAs drained overnight. Crises of modern times but forseen, at least in its potentiality and broadest strokes, by Brooklyn author Sol Yurick. I remember reading \booktitle{Behold Metatron, the Recording Angel}, an essay by Brooklyn author Sol Yurick, published by Autonomedia (Foreign Agents Press) back in 1985. I think I picked up my copy in Park Slope's Community Books, back in the day. Yurick also is the author of \booktitle{The Warriors}, made into a classic, apocalyptic gang film, as well as the excellent novels \booktitle{Fertig}, \booktitle{The Bag}, \booktitle{Someone Just Like You}, \booktitle{Richard A.} and \booktitle{Confession,} and other articles and essays. \booktitle{Behold Metatron} is heavy stuff, relentlessly visionary, the material problem seen through a lens of advanced capitalism and electronic philosophy. Picture \journaltitle{Wired Magazine} crossed with \journaltitle{Fortune Magazine} but edited by William Blake. Metaphysics, economics, art and intellect of an high order, coalescing into an interpretation of an emerging electronic universe. Forget Al Gore\footnote{In a March 9, 1999, interview with CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer, Al Gore was discussing his history as a senator who extensively supported internet development. A sentence said by Gore in the interview, \enquote{I took the initiative in creating the Internet,} became a widespread meme around Y2K. The joke was that Gore claimed to have invented the internet. --- Salitter Workings Editor}, perhaps Mr. Yurick conceptualized, if not anticipated, the Internet, globalization, the flow of information and data across galaxies of cable and wireless realms, sometimes directed, sometimes chaotic, but always having impact. Mr. Yurick \enquote{\ldots\ The old philosopher's stone could convert base metals into gold. Now humans, real estate, social relations are converted into electronic signs carried in an electronic plasma. the dream of magical control has never been exorcised. Perhaps, after all, modern capitalism is a great factory for the production of angels.} In 1988, the journal \journaltitle{Social Text} published Mr. Yurick's \booktitle{The Destiny Algorithm} which appeared to further mine the cybernetic\slash human nexus. Globalization and the 'net got its philosophic underprinnings where else, Brooklyn NY. \end{quotation} \signoff{--- the Amazon.com description for \booktitle{Metatron}\footnote{sic} by Sol Yurick.} }

To suppose that any author of fiction, poetry or discursive writing works alone is a conceit fostered by the Nineteenth Century. Of course one always has collaborators, advice, and even opposition. Here are some of the people who helped me: Bert Cowlan, Martin Elton, Karen Paulsell, Hesh Wiener, Peter Krass, John Verity, Joan Greenbaum, Peter Brooks, Robert Shapiro, Ken Donow, Jean McDermott, Herb Schiller, Oscar Urgeteche, George Caffentzis, Silvia Federici, Robert Greenblatt. Of course, they might not agree with my ideas or the way I used their help. I alone am responsible for what has resulted. \emph{Metatron} is also in partial fulfillment of a Guggenheim Foundation grant.
